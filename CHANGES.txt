# CHANGELOG #

## Version 0.11.0, 2017-11-30 ##

- New feature: pareidoscope_associated_structures supports associated
  larger structures that contain lemmata (option -l/--lemmata).
- Bugfix in pareidoscope_associated_structures: The sample size was
  determined on the basis of the wrong graph and was too small.
- Internal change: We use threads instead of subprocesses for filling
  the processing queues.

## Version 0.10.2, 2017-10-11 ##

We switched from NetworkX 1.x to 2.0. The 1.x branch is no longer
supported.

## Version 0.10.1, 2017-10-09 ##

Minor change: NetworkX released version 2.0 but we still require the
1.x branch.

## Version 0.10.0, 2017-06-28 ##
